goal: convert English to and back from a generic "theme" language (using opencl, find header + library download)

Thematic roles: agent, patient, benefactive

> [!NOTE]
> While the determination of which thematic roles exist is contentious, I'm not looking for an objective set of thematic roles, just ones that function well enough for this program

thematic roles relate noun phrases to verbs, and the way that relation can be realized differs from language to language (each language has its own grammar which it uses to convert a "universal meaning" to a language specific structure). so whereas English converts [eat][agent:1st person][patient:fish] to "I ate a fish," just copying the structure word-for-word into Spanish doesn't work because it has a different grammar.
- a thematic role that maps to the subject in English may map to the object in another language.
- while English might use a preposition to convey the meaning of "in," another language might use a noun case for example

adjectives and stuff can't be modeled with solely a thematic model but that's w/e
